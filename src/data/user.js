	about: {
		title: "Iâ€™m Chris Noble, I live in Vancouver, where I build the future.",
		description: "Born and raised in Vancouver, BC, I've been working in the software industry since September 2021, but fell in love with building before I used a computer. I've worked on a number of projects in recent years, most proudly the compliance reporting tool I built at Treez. This project automated both on-demand and preiodically scheduled reporting to the Washington government. Tools I used were Cypress, Docker, AWS Batch, Fargate, ECR, Event Bridge, Lambda, S3, SES. Outside of work, I recharge by training jiu jitsu or spending time near the ocean. My imagination thrives on a clean state of mind.",
